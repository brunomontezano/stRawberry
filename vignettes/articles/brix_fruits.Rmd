```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

# Import

```{r setup}
library(stRawberry)
```

# Is there any difference in brix degrees and number of fruits between Albion, San Andreas and Portola?

```{r}
# Create a list containing all experiments and other list with measures
experiments <- c("Solo", "Deitado", "Dupla", "Em pÃ©")
measure <- c("brix", "frutos")

# Cross all possibilities
crossed <- tidyr::crossing(
  experiments,
  measure
)

purrr::map2(
  crossed$measure,
  crossed$experiments,
  ~ diffAnalysis(var = .x, experiment = .y)
) %>% purrr::set_names(
  paste0(
    crossed$measure, " no experimento ", crossed$experiments)
) %>% 
  purrr::map(~ .x[[2]])
```

As we can observe in the Tukey test output, there are significant differences in the brix degrees and number of fruits only in the "Solo" experiment.
