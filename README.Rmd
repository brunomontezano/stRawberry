The goal of stRawberry is to store the analyzes referring to strawberry experiments. The data were collected by Filipe Oliveira Mendes.

## Installation

The current version of stRawberry can be installed with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("brunomontezano/stRawberry")
```

## Website

The website version of this package can be acessed through
[GitHub Pages](https://brunomontezano.github.io/stRawberry/).

## Language

The vast majority of the material present in the functions, pkgdown articles and command outputs in this repository are in Brazilian Portuguese, although the documentation is in English.

This is because the undergraduate thesis from these analyzes is written in Brazilian Portuguese. Therefore, the communcation between project authors can be simplified.
